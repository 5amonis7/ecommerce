            <p>Backpacks are a key item for many types of people: working professionals, travelers, hikers and, most of all, students. While the idea of carrying a backpack is getting outdated, the modern student backpack is quite young, only about 44 years old and has seen many new changes in a short amount of time. From leather straps to JanSport packs, backpacks are still catching up with today's times.</p>
