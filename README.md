*** This is not a live store but only meant for practice ***

This is now mobile and desktop

This is a test project that I am working on revolving around an ecommerce store.

This website has a functioning cart, product page where the products are beign read from a file, dynamic navbar, working contact me that just emails me and a simple design layout
with lorem ipsum as a filler in certain spots as a placeholder.
